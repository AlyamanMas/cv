ABSTRACT = {Electricity theft remains a pressing challenge in modern smart grid systems, leading to significant economic losses and compromised grid stability. This paper presents a sensor-driven framework for electricity theft detection that leverages data collected from smart meter sensors, key components in smart grid monitoring infrastructure. The proposed approach combines prototype learning and meta-level ensemble learning to develop a scalable and accurate detection model, capable of identifying zero-day attacks that are not present in the training data. Smart meter data is compressed using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and K-means clustering to extract representative consumption patterns, i.e., prototypes, achieving a 92% reduction in dataset size while preserving critical anomaly-relevant features. These prototypes are then used to train base-level one-class classifiers, specifically the One-Class Support Vector Machine (OCSVM) and the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). The outputs of these classifiers are normalized and fused in a meta-OCSVM layer, which learns decision boundaries in the transformed score space. Experimental results using the Irish CER Smart Metering Project (SMP) dataset show that the proposed sensor-based detection framework achieves superior performance, with an accuracy of 88.45% and a false alarm rate of just 13.85%, while reducing training time by over 75%. By efficiently processing high-frequency smart meter sensor data, this model contributes to developing real-time and energy-efficient anomaly detection systems in smart grid environments.},
